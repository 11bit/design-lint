/**
 * The extraction-shaped subset of the contracts in `test/contracts/`.
 *
 * `test/extract/sweep.test.js` and `element.test.js` assert exactly which tokens come out
 * of a given shape. This file asserts something coarser and more important: that for every
 * case a rule *promises to catch*, extraction puts at least one class token in front of it.
 * A rule cannot report what it never sees, so a promise whose string never arrives is a hole
 * in the extractor rather than in the rule — and this is where that shows up, before the
 * rule is blamed for it.
 *
 * Two rules are outside it, and not because they are hard. `no-style-color` reads a `style`
 * object, and `no-raw-color` reads values — SVG attributes, style values, string constants —
 * so neither promise is made of class strings. Asserting class extraction over their cases
 * would assert nothing about either.
