/**
 * Which resolved inputs each rule is bound to.
 *
 * A rule's *options* are what a consumer writes, and they are JSON. Its *inputs* are what
 * only a load step can produce — the design-system policy view and the semantic token set —
 * and they are bound around `create` instead. This map is the one place that says which rule
 * takes which, so the plugin and the test harness cannot drift into binding different
 * things.
 *
 * A rule absent from this map needs neither: `no-style-color` reads only its own options,
 * and `no-useless-hover` decides interactivity from the element, not from the theme.
